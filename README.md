Orig:

windows 7 + 8 touch for OF

- using 'hooks' to catch touch events before the window processes the events
- no need to modify glfw/glu source with hooks
- tested on win7+8 with OF 0.9 with Visual Studio 2015
- added #define USE_WM_POINTER_EVENTS to ofxWinTouchHook.h to receive WM_POINTER events only (win8), comment out for WM_TOUCH
